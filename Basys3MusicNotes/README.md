# VHDL Code for Producing 8 Musical Notes on Basys 3

This repository contains VHDL code that enables the Basys 3 FPGA board to produce 8 different musical notes using its switches. Each switch corresponds to a unique note: Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si, and Do-8va. This project is inspired by the original work by qzxtu.

## Introduction

This VHDL project allows you to transform your Basys 3 FPGA board into a musical instrument, playing 8 distinct notes by toggling the switches. The project utilizes the power of FPGA hardware to generate musical tones and produce sound.

## Hardware Requirements

To implement this project, you will need the following:

- Basys 3 FPGA board
- Xilinx Vivado development environment
- VGA monitor (optional, for visual feedback)
- Headphones or speakers

## Usage
Power on your Basys 3 board.

Toggle the switches on the Basys 3 board to play the different musical notes:

Switch 0: Do
Switch 1: Re
Switch 2: Mi
Switch 3: Fa
Switch 4: Sol
Switch 5: La
Switch 6: Si
Switch 7: Do-8va

Enjoy the musical tones played through your headphones or speakers!
