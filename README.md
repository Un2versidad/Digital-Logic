### The Basys 3 development board offers a wide range of components and features for digital design and experimentation:

- **Clock:** An internal clock that Verilog projects can utilize, featuring an additional line for configuration.
  
- **Switches:** 16 switches located along the bottom edge of the board.
  
- **LEDs:** 16 small LEDs positioned above the switches along the bottom of the board.
  
- **7-Segment Display:** A 4-digit 7-segment display.
  
- **Pushbuttons/Buttons:** Five accessible buttons in the middle of the board. These buttons are designed to prevent bouncing.
  
- **PMOD Headers:** These are 4-pin and 12-pin connectors located on the sides of the board, allowing communication with external devices.
  
- **VGA Connector:** VGA port for graphical display capabilities.
  
- **USB Connections:** Interfaces for communication through USB.
  
- **Quad SPI Flash:** Flash memory for storage.
